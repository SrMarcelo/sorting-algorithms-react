This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Local Development

To run the project locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see a live preview of the project.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [this](https://github.com/devoups-off/sorting-app) other project. I wanted to try to make a similar project using Next.js and TailwindCSS to train my react skills and learn more about Next.js. I also wanted to put my own touch on the project.

I thought it would be a good idea to implement the sorting algorithms myself to train what I learned in my Data Structures University class.

## What I'll use

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

These are the main technologies that i plan to use to make this project. About the algorithms, I will implement the following:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bogosort

Bogosort will be implemented just for fun, as it's not a real-world used sorting algorithm.
